## MoodMusic
This is a recreation of a Software Engineering project called MoodyMusic using React.

## How it works
Using MoodMusic, one can generate chord progressions to develop ideas for new or existing songs! Modify the tempo, key, instrument, and pattern. View chord progressions on a piano or guitar diagram to learn how to play the progression on the fly with your instrument of choice.

## Development
Currently in the works and being frequently updated. Chord shuffling is functional.
